Some single-page dice games in various states of completion

## Qwixx
v 0.8.0
This game is nearing completion and should be good as a scoresheet. The dice rolls also work but strictly enforcing rules based on the dice rolls is not quite done yet.

## Farkle
v 0.7.0
This game is usable, but to make settings changes, you must edit the javascript directly. It's not currently very end-user friendly.
