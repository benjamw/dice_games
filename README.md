Some single-page dice games in various states of completion

## Qwixx
v 0.9.0
This game is nearing completion and should be good as a scoresheet. The dice rolls also work but strictly enforcing rules based on the dice rolls is not quite done yet.

## Farkle
v 0.2.0
This game is not done. And should not be used yet.
